# Reduce friction and latency for long-running jobs with Webhooks in Gemini API

Reduce friction and latency for long-running jobs with Webhooks in Gemini API
Today, we're making it easier and more efficient to build complex, long-running agentic applications with the Gemini API. We are introducing event-driven Webhooks, a push-based notification system that eliminates the need for inefficient polling.
As Gemini shifts toward agentic workflows and high-volume processing — like Deep Research, long video generation, or processing thousands of prompts via the Batch API — operations can take minutes or even hours. Until now, developers had to rely on continuous polling (e.g., repeatedly callingGET
operations) to check if a job was completed.
Now, the Gemini API can simply push a real-time HTTP POST payload to your server the instant a task finishes.
We’ve built this with reliability and security in mind. Our implementation strictly adheres to the [Standard Webhooks](https://github.com/standard-webhooks/standard-webhooks) specification. Every request is signed using webhook-signature
, webhook-id
, and webhook-timestamp
headers, ensuring idempotency and preventing replay attacks. We also guarantee "at-least-once" delivery with automatic retries for up to 24 hours.
How it works
You can configure webhooks globally at the project level (secured via HMAC), or override them dynamically on a per-request basis to route specific jobs (secured via JWKS).
Here's a quick example of how you can dynamically configure a webhook for a batch task using the Python SDK:

This feature is available now for all developers using the Gemini API:
- Read the guide: Check out the
[Webhooks documentation](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/webhooks)to explore the full event catalog and learn how to secure your endpoints. - Hands-on practice: We've prepared a comprehensive
[Cookbook](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook/blob/main/quickstarts/Webhooks.ipynb)to help you build an end-to-end integration with webhooks.
