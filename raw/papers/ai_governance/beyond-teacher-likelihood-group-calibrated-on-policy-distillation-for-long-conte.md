## Abstract

On-policy distillation (OPD) trains a student on its own responses using dense token-level guidance from a stronger teacher. In long-context tasks, however, token-level teacher support can favor locally plausible responses that omit evidence distributed across the input or violate global task constraints. Task-specific verifiers, in contrast, evaluate task completion at the response level and may return graded rewards that reflect partial success. We diagnose this mismatch on fixed responses from two representative long-context evidence-aggregation tasks. Across longer input ranges, trajectory-level OPD scores become progressively less aligned with verifier rewards, indicating teacher-verifier disagreement. Motivated by this observation, we introduce Group-Calibrated On-Policy Distillation (GC-OPD). GC-OPD separately normalizes verifier rewards and trajectory-level OPD scores within each rollout group and uses their difference as a signed teacher-verifier disagreement residual. Relative-advantage-based credit assignment (RACA) distributes this trajectory-level residual across tokens according to their relative OPD advantages while preserving the original OPD signal. Across five long-context benchmarks, post-training with GC-OPD raises the five-benchmark averages of the official Qwen3-4B and Qwen3-8B checkpoints from 29.08 to 40.47 and from 35.12 to 44.65, respectively. Vanilla OPD reaches 39.31 and 43.56 under the same setup. Controlled ablations show that the signed residual is more effective than either an additional OPD-derived term or direct group-normalized verifier reward addition, while RACA further improves over uniform token allocation. Together, these results demonstrate that group-relative residual calibration can incorporate verifier outcomes without discarding dense token-level guidance.
