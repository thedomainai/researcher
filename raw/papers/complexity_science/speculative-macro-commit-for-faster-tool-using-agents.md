## Abstract

Tool-using LLM agents spend wall-clock time not only on model inference but also in serial action--observation turns, where each tool call, environment transition, and observation can delay subsequent decisions. We introduce \textbf{Speculative Macro Commit} (SMC), a runtime mechanism for a two-tier agent system: a large authoritative actor model produces the official trajectory, while a faster speculative drafter model continuously predicts and executes future action chains on an isolated environment snapshot. SMC mines recurring multi-action skeletons from training traces and stores them in a macro library used to match against action chains predicted by the drafter at runtime. When the actor's next tool call matches the first drafted action, SMC commits the remaining pre-executed draft steps, together with their observations, to the official trajectory. Using Qwen3.5-27B INT4 as the authoritative actor model and Qwen3.5-4B as the speculative drafter model, SMC matches the sequential agent's overall accuracy while reducing latency by 10.23\% over the Speculative Actions (SA) baseline and 18.59\% over sequential execution on the $τ^2$-Bench Telecom subset. On AppWorld, SMC reduces wall time by 7.7\% over SA baseline and 44.9\% over sequential execution, with a small reduction in task completion. Overall, SMC provides a practical way to reuse multi-step speculative execution and reduce agent latency beyond single-step speculative actions.
