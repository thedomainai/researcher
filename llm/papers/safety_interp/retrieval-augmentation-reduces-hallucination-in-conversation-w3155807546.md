## Abstract

Despite showing increasingly human-like conversational abilities, state-of-the-art dialogue models often suffer from factual incorrectness and hallucination of knowledge (Roller et al., 2021).In this work we explore the use of neural-retrieval-in-the-loop architectures -recently shown to be effective in open-domain QA (Lewis et al., 2020b; Izacard and Grave, 2021b) -for knowledge-grounded dialogue, a task that is arguably more challenging as it requires querying based on complex multi-turn dialogue context and generating conversationally coherent responses.We study various types of architectures with multiple components -retrievers, rankers, and encoder-decoders -with the goal of maximizing knowledgeability while retaining conversational ability.We demonstrate that our best models obtain state-of-the-art performance on two knowledge-grounded conversational tasks.The models exhibit open-domain conversational capabilities, generalize effectively to scenarios not within the training data, and, as verified by human evaluations, substantially reduce the well-known problem of knowledge hallucination in state-of-the-art chatbots. * Equal ContributionThe following is a conversation with an AI assistant.The assistant is helpful, creative, clever, and very friendly.Human: Hello, who are you?AI: I am an AI created by OpenAI.How can I help you today?Human: Tell me about Kyunghyun
